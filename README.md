# Generic DAM

A collection of Drupal modules for turning an existing site into a Digital Assets Management platform.

Although this MIGHT be compatible with existing sites, this feature-set is meant to be used on a dedicated Drupal 8 instance, not existing sites. Development is taking this into account, compatibility with non-DAM sites is not a goal. Basically, think of this as a distro/starter kit.
